      <p id="end" >High-level languages made the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable, and less bound to the underlying hardware. The first compiler related tool, the A-0 System, was developed in 1952[11] by Grace Hopper, who also coined the term 'compiler'.[12][13] FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to have a functional implementation, came out in 1957,[14] and many other languages were soon developed—in particular, COBOL aimed at commercial data processing, and Lisp for computer research.</p>
